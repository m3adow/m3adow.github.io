A friend of mine recently asked me to find Pump Express compatible chargers. I never heard that term, so I needed to research it. Apparently Pump Express is the fast charging solution of mid budget chip maker Mediatek. It's the direct competitor to Quick Charge from Qualcomm or Oppos VOOC/OnePlus Dash Charge (they are using identical technology).  
But in contrast to the formerly mentioned competing technologies where you can easily find chargers on Amazon ([Quick Charge][qcs]/[VOOC][voocs]), finding Pump Express compatible chargers wasn't as easy.

But that's only because Mediatek did their charging technology the right way. To quote from Mediateks [Pump Express Marketing Site][pe_pr]:

> The technology is compatible with the international standard of ‘USB PD 3.0 programmable power supplies’, allowing standard USB PD 3.0 fast chargers to boost Pump Express 4.0-enabled smartphones.

So instead of relying on a proprietary technique, they are utilizing USB Power Delivery. Therefore any USB PD 3.0 compatible charger should be able to "pump" the battery of your smartphone. I did some searches on **[Amazon.com][pe_amazon]**, **[Amazon.co.uk][pe_amazon_uk]** and **[Amazon.de][pe_amazon_de]** so all of the less tech savy people can choose a device of their liking without the need of delving deeper. ;-)
