I've been inactive for a long time and I won't promise any more activity. I just wanted to inform all potential feed readers that I will remove Codebites as their own section soon. The plans I initially had with Codebites didn't work well, Life and Work prevented me from writing more posts, so I don't think having the few posts I write separated into different sections makes any sense. Therefore from now on all posts will be available in the one (and only) [RSS feed (feed.xml)][feed] once again. This may lead to some old and/or already read posts reappearing in your feeds. Also, if you're using one of the deprecated ones, you may encounter problems. While I tried redirecting the old RSS feeds to the new one (with Javascript, which surprisingly worked best for the three applications I tested with), I'm not certain all RSS readers support redirects.

[feed]: {% link pages/feed.xml %}
