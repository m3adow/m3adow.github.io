For the few readers who have subscribed to my blog via RSS: I'm deeply sorry if you got the last 10 posts of me delivered over and over again. The last days I was in the progress of fixing errors which were introduced when converting from Wordpress to Jekyll and resulted in [over 9000!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0dx1LfDFaE) (Okay, only ~6000) 404 errors. It were mostly errors made by myself. Wrong substitutions, typos, wrong assumptions were only three of many. I now cleaned up everything I could find, so I really hope you won't get annoyed anymore.

You can't imagine how satisfying this LinkChecker report feels to me. :images//-)
