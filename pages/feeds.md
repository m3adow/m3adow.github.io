There are three different feeds available: 

**[Blog RSS Feed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/feed.xml %}):**
Includes all [Blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/archive.html %}). Blog posts are more elaborate than Codebites and therefore published less often. **Frequency: 1/month**

**[Codebites RSS Feed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/codebites-feed.xml %}):**
Only includes [Codebites]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/codebites.html %}). Codebites are "set and forget" posts. Very little explanation, sometimes even plain output. Therefore they are quick and easy to create. **Frequency: ~2/month**

**[Complete RSS Feed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/all-feed.xml %}):** 
Includes all Blog posts and Codebites and - if I ever create new categories - these as well.

The frequencies are rough estimations, so take them with a grain of salt.
