## Me
I'm merely an ordinary DevOps Engineer fascinated by technology. I like playing
 around with new or old tech, solving problems which I didn't know even existed
 one week ago and doing all this while trying to cope with my family.

 If you want to know more about me or my projects, check my linked profiles in the footer.
