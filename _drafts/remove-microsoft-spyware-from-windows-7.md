When hearing about the big spyware mess Microsoft decided to integrate into Windows 10, I abstained from my intentions to upgrade to Windows 10 in the near future. Although there is an [open source tool](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking) which disables most of the tracking, I want to wait until the dust has settled and see what remains.
Sadly, Microsoft decided that users who not switched to Windows 10 yet, will still be spied upon. There were a lot of Windows updates in the last weeks, which implement a lot of "features" similar to the ones in Win 10. The icing on the cake is the decision of Microsoft to [download Windows 10](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2425381/microsoft-is-downloading-windows-10-to-your-machine-just-in-case) to your PC, even if you didn't install the necessary update.

As I neither like this stupid decision, nor the spyware on my PC, I decided to write a guide how to uninstall the whole crapload of it.
